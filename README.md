# MEAN tutorials
some basic tutorials i did to learn MEAN stack off some medium posts.

## todoapp
this is a basic todo-list app, where you make notes of todo list items and CRUD them. except the D doesn't work. idk why.

in /todoapp:

`npm install --save bluebird mongoose mongoose-paginate nodemon`

to run: 

`npm start`

## notably
a basic note-taking app, eerily similar to 'todoapp'....
